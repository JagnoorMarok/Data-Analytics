# Statistical Hypothesis Testing with Iris Dataset  

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the application of statistical hypothesis testing techniques on the Iris dataset. It includes Z-tests, T-tests, and Chi-square tests to analyze numerical and categorical variables. Visualizations and Python code snippets accompany the results, making the analysis more engaging and accessible.  

## Features  
- **Z-Test**: Compare means of numerical variables across groups.  
- **T-Test**: Test mean differences without known population standard deviation.  
- **Chi-Square Test**: Assess relationships between categorical variables.  
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representation of results for better interpretation.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `scipy`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn`  

## Repository Contents  
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebook files containing implementation and visualizations.  
- **`data/`**: The Iris dataset used for analysis.  
- **`README.md`**: Project description and instructions.  
- **`report/`**: Detailed project report.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
